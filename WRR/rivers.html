          <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h3>

          <p>
            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
            Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
            River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
            rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and
            deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
            sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
            with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches
            in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon
            is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a
            free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
            are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
            swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

        <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
        <p>
            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
            the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
             beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
             from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
              scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity,
               and great whitewater opportunities.

            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
            
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
            This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

            <h3>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>

            <p>
                This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
                You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to 
                make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                
                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically
                 rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, 
                 most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

          <h2>More Than Just The Thrill</h2>
          <p>
            Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and
            high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to
            get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great
            outdoors.
