      Eventually, you will be able to input your ingredients and instructions
      and then the submit button would add that recipe to the recipes page.
      Possibly there would be a photo upload for the new recipe and placeholder
      images if you dont want to upload the photos. Not sure yet how this would
      work, but the user would also have some way to log in to the site so that
      they will have all of their added recipes no matter where or when they log
      in
