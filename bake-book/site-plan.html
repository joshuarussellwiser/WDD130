      <h3>Homestyle Bread</h3>
      <p>
        Bread Recipe:
        2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
        1/2 cup white sugar
        1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
        1 1/2 teaspoons salt
        1/4 cup vegetable oil
        5-6 cups flour. You can use all-purpose flour OR bread flour!
        In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
        Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time.
        Knead dough for 7 minutes. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
        Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9×5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30-40 minutes.
        Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!
